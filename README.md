# Module5

# In this module you we were able to use simulations to determine the probability of financial outcomes for select portfolios based on certain paramaters.  This information is useful when determining if certain individuals have enough savings to start investing and once they are investing what those probable outcomes look like based on Monte Carlo simulations.
